### IRONHACK MIDTERM PROJECT: Case Study Regression

This project is part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp, which will take place from October 2021 to December 2021 at IRON HACK in Berlin, Germany.

## Project Intro/Objective

The goal of this project is to forecast the price of houses (as supplied in the.csv) based on the other information related to property transactions in the Seattle region in 2014-2015.
As a supplementary goal, we were entrusted with determining whether homes worth more than $650,000 had special causes, as compared to lower-priced houses.
This was my first solo project finished during the bootcamp, and it was aimed to put my knowledge of MySQL, Python (and associated libraries such as NUMPY, SCIKITLEARN, PANDAS, and so on) to the test, as well as to introduce me to Tableau.

Please examine the.md files in the different folders for the full specs of the various portions of the project, and the.csv that was utilized is also available in this repository.

#### Methods Employed
Linear Regression & other forms of regressions analysis,
Machine Learning,
Data Visualization,
Kanban

### Technologies
Python,
MySql,
Pandas, jupyter,
SkLearn,
Numpy,
Tableau

### Description of the Project

The IRONHACK team donated the data for this project, which was in general a reasonably clean dataset.

Initially, I was charged with investigating the data in MySql and then performing more EDA, cleaning, and wrangling within my Jupyter Notebook using Python and its accompanying modules. Tableau was used to construct the visualization.

The project faced several problems, including the following:

1. This is my first time trying something like this. As a result, I spent a significant amount of work on structure and hope that the project is straightforward to understand.
2. Tableau was something we had hardly dabbled with prior to this. As a result, certain visualisations were less than optimal, but I am confident that this will improve with the next contribution.

### This project's requirements

data exploration/descriptive statistics,
data processing/cleaning,
statistical modeling,
writeup/reporting

### Featured Notebooks/Analysis/Deliverables

Overall, we had to produce a MySql query book, a Jupyter notebook, a Tableau dashboard, this readme file, and a presentation (tba)
